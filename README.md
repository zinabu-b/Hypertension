## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
A machine learning system that predicts patient hypertension risk (High/Low) using XGBoost, explains predictions via SHAP values, and provides treatment recommendations through a Streamlit interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Risk Prediction**: Binary classification (High/Low risk) using XGBoost.  
- **Explainability**: SHAP force plots to interpret model decisions.  
- **Treatment Suggestions**: Rule-based recommendations based on risk level.  
- **User-Friendly UI**: Interactive web app built with Streamlit.
